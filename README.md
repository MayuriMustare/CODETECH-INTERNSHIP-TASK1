Overview of the Project

Project: Simple Calculator

A] Objective: 
The objective of this program is to create a simple and interactive calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It ensures user-friendly interaction, robust input validation, and error handling to deliver accurate results.


B] Key Activities:
1. Displaying Menu Options: Presenting the user with a clear list of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to choose from.
2. Taking User Input: Prompting the user to select an operation and input two numeric values for the calculation.
3. Validating Input: Ensuring that the operation choice is valid and the numeric inputs are properly formatted, while handling errors like invalid entries or division by zero.
4. Performing Calculations: Executing the selected operation and computing the result based on the user's inputs.


C] Technologies Used:
i] Programming Language: Python
The entire program is implemented in Python, utilizing its simplicity and capabilities for arithmetic operations and user interaction.

ii] Core Python Features:
1. print() Function: Used to display messages, instructions, and results to the user.
2. input() Function: Used to take inputs from the user interactively.
3. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /): Used for performing mathematical operations.
4. Conditional Statements (if-elif-else): Used to implement the logic for selecting and executing the appropriate calculation based on user input.
   
iii] Error Handling:
try-except Blocks: Used to handle invalid numeric inputs (non-numeric characters) gracefully without crashing the program.

iv] Data Types:
float Conversion: Converts user input to floating-point numbers for precise arithmetic operations.

v] Interactive Console Programming:
Provides an interactive interface where users can input data and view results in the console.
